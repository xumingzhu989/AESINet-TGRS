# AESINet-TGRS
This is a repository for the paper "Adaptive Edge-aware Semantic Interaction Network for Salient Object Detection in Optical Remote Sensing Images", accepted by IEEE TGRS 2023.

### Note
Since the author is a student, he has been busy with his studies recently and has not been able to organize the code.
The current version of the code is an unorganized first version of the code, and the author will organize all the code as soon as possible to facilitate the use of other researchers.
(It is expected to be fully sorted out by September 1, 2023)
