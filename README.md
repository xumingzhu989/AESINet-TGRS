### Train&Test
Please download the pre-trained model and dataset first, put them under the path of the model, and change the corresponding path in the code.
Then use generateTrainList.py and generateTestList.py to generate the path lists of the training set and the test set.
Change the dataset path in the code to the path of the dataset listing file (.txt) you specified.

### Note
Currently, both ResNet and VGG versions of AESINet codes have been uploaded.

There is still room for improvement in the readability of the code, and the author will update the version with better readability as soon as possible.
